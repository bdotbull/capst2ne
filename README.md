# Rocket League Image Classifier
#
A simple CNN which takes a screenshot from Rocket League as input and outputs the name of the car the player is using. The network was trained in a test environment on the three most popular bodies used in competitive play:
- Dominus
- Fennec
- Octane

### Info on my Capstone projects:
- [Capstone 1](https://github.com/bdotbull/rl-stats-eda) -
Statistical analysis on over 5,000 Rocket League games to determine if a particular mechanic affects game balance.
- [Capstone 2](https://github.com/bdotbull/capst2ne) -
A simple CNN image classifier. The network looks at a screenshot of Rocket League and outputs the name of the car the player is using. Trained on the three most popular vehicle bodies used in the game.
- [Capstone 3](https://github.com/bdotbull/rl_cap3) -
RLBot/Q-Learning environment. Project started with building an autonomous agent to play Rocket League. I wanted to learn more about reinforcement learning, so I built a simplified soccer game along the way.
